# underack
A Eurorack/VCV Rack inspired, modular MIDI-generator

## About

In the same way that modular synth systems generate voltages which are used as inputs to oscilators to create music, the underack project aims to generate MIDI messages that can be used by VST plugins, DAWs, and MIDI software/hardware to generate:

* rhythmic patterns
* harmonies
* melodies
* and variations on all of the above
